# atmega16-projects

This repository contains my atmega16 microcontroller projects from university. The projects are written in C using CodeVision and the circuit designs are implemented using Proteus. All projects are configured with a clock frequency of 8 MHz and include a code file in C and a Proteus circuit screenshot.
